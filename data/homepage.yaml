      We are the robotics team based out of Shawnee Mission Northwest High School in Lenexa, Kansas. We are a student-led team that designs, builds, and programs robots to compete in competition. We are a team that is open to all students, regardless of experience or skill level. We are always looking for new members to join our team! Also most of the content on this site as of now is ripped from the SMNW site, need a graphic designer for logo and need to source some photos for the carousel.
